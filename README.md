# GOT_Data_Analysis
I try to quantify data from George RR Martin's ASOIAF book series to make predictions about what will happen in his upcoming novels.

## Army Size - Does the larger army have an advantage on the battlefield?
No! Ironically, there is a slightly negative correlation between army size and battle outcomes. The correlation is too small to be considered statistically significant and no meaningful conclusions can be made based on the limited quantitative data we have. George RR Martin does not go into great detail about the number of combatants so we only have reliable data from 12 battle sequences but nonetheless it is interesting to see that the smaller army is victorious in the majority of these battles.
